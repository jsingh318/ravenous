Ravenous

This project on building a website called “ravenous”, a Yelp-like clone.

In total, it will be targeting these main parts:
Creating Static Components
Passing Information to Components
Setting the State of Ravenous Components
Interacting with the Yelp API

Here’s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:

As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

In the end should be able to search a restaurant in any area of choice.
